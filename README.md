# Customer-Complain-Resolver
An AI-powered system that classifies customer complaints into categories using Random Forest and generates resolutions with FLAN-T5. It cleans and processes text with NLP techniques and supports both batch and real-time complaint handling.

AI Customer Complaint Resolver
This project classifies customer complaints into categories and generates suggested resolutions using a combination of classical machine learning (Random Forest) and transformer-based models (FLAN-T5).

Features
Cleans and preprocesses complaint text (lowercasing, removing numbers/punctuation, stemming, lemmatization).
Classifies complaints into predefined categories using a Random Forest classifier trained on TF-IDF features.
Uses Google's FLAN-T5 transformer to generate a natural language resolution for the complaint.
Allows dynamic user input for real-time predictions.
